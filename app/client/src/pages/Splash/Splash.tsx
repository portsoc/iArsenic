                    `Groundwater is an attractive source of drinking water particularly
                    in developing countries, as it can be supplied untreated. To avoid
                    waterborne pathogenic diseases, governments and NGOs encouraged
                    installation of millions of tubewells – low-cost mechanical hand-pump
                    wells – in Bangladesh. This has inadvertently exposed around ca.
                    40% consumers to arsenic which is naturally present in the groundwater.
                    Over 20 million Bangladeshi people are exposed to this insidious toxin,
                    resulting in multi-systemic effects including cancer, through the use
                    of ~10 million tubewells. Switching to a safe well has been a major
                    mitigation option for rural inhabitants, but 6 million wells are yet
                    to be tested. Building on existing research, we believe that computer
                    modelling and digital technology can help solve this issue.`

                    of groundwater iron oxide and indicates likely presence of As, particularly if
                    the well is shallow (<100 m below ground level) and located in an arsenic-prone

                    platform (a geochemical indicator), the well depth, and street address
                    (producing a 3D location indicator). People living in rural Bangladesh
                    can identify the staining and generally will know the well-depth to sufficient
                    accuracy. We have already utilised these observational indicators and a

                    The existing prototype uses a small subset of the available data samples
                    from over 4 million tubewells; in this project we would clean more data,
