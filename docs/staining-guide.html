            <h2>Staining Guide</h2>
            <p>The staining on a tube well platform and/or domestic utensils is an indication of the underlying geology
                and redox condition. This guide describes the differences between red and black staining to assist you
                in identifying any staining on a given tube well.</p>

            <h3>Red Staining</h3>

            <p>Red staining is associated with iron reduction that may lead to the release of arsenic and will likely
                indicate unsafe drinking-water, particularly for shallow wells.</p>

        <section id="blackStaining">
            <h3>Black Staining</h3>

            <p>Black staining is associated with manganese reduction and will likely indicate safe drinking-water; any
                arsenic released due to manganese reduction will be absorbed back into the unreduced iron.</p>
