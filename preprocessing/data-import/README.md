## About

The purpose of the files in data-import is to make importing well data in the .RData
format more straightforward.

To use .RData it needs to be converted to .csv format and we need to ensure the names
of the regions in the new data match the names in our current data.#

The .RData is converted to .csv with the rdata-to-csv.r and consolidate-csv.js scripts.

Name corrections for the new data is generated using the find-name-corrections.js script.

These name corrections can then be used by /iArsenic/preprocessing/lib/load-data.js to apply
to any given dataset currently being loaded.

Having a consistent regions names is important so we don't mistake wells in the same
region as wells in different regions.

## Typical Use

1. Insert .RData files into r-data-rdata/
2. Run rdata-to-csv.r with the following command:

  Rscript rdata-to-csv.r r-data-rdata r-data-csv

  _Rscript rdata-to-csv.r [directory containing r data] [output directory]_

  This will convert the files in r-data-rdata/ to csv and ouput them in r-data-csv/

3. Run consolidate-csv.js with the following command:

  node consolidate-csv.js r-data-csv/\*.csv > consolidated-csv.csv

  _node consolidate-csv.js [directory containing rdata-to-csv.r output]\*.csv > [output directory/filename.csv]_

  Note that the consolidate-csv.js script uses the standard output so redirect is used
  to send the output to a file (the name of this file can be anything)

4. find-name-corrections.js can then be used on the output of consolidate-csv.js
to identify and incorrectly spelt regions and record correct alternatives.

  To run find-name-corrections.js:

  node find-name-corrections.js -i [output-of-consolidate-csv.js] -o [name-corrections-file.csv]

  **The output of find-name-corrections should have a .csv extension.**
